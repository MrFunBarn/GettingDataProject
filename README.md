# Getting Data Final Project


Files:

run_analysis.R - Contains the R script to transform the raw data into a tidy dataset.

CodeBook.md - Discusses how the tidy data differs from the original data.

## Use

To produce the tidy data, simply place the script in the same directory as the zip file containg the original data. Then unzip the original data and run run_analysis.R. The tidy data will be saved as a plain text file, tidy-table.txt.
